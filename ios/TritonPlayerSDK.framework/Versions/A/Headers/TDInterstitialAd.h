/**
 * The TDInterstitialAd class is used to request and display Triton interstitial ads. 
 *
 * Interstitial ads, like pre-rolls and mid-rolls, are full screen ads displayed in natural transition points of the app. I.e. Playing a video ad before the user start to listen to a station. Audio and video interstitials are supported. It's recommended to preload the ad long before it is displayed.
